JSON Humanizer for Safari
=============

Safari extension built to prevent headaches from dealing with gigantic JSON outputs.

The JSON will be beautified, color-formatted, enhanced with toggles and optimised for reading.

Black/white themes are available from extension's settings.

You're welcome.

How to use it
-------------
First [install the extension](https://github.com/budaride/JSONHumanizer/blob/master/Releases/JSONHumanizer.safariextz) in Safari. You'll find the [latest release here](https://github.com/budaride/JSONHumanizer/tree/master/Releases).

Then open up [any JSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/budaride/JSONHumanizer/master/examples/random-data.json), and finally read it.
